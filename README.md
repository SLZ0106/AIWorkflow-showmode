##  1.1. Project Brief

“Create a tool which will allow a user to connect a defined set of 3rd party applications and execute actions when conditions have been met. E. G when a tweet containing ‘ibm’ is detected place content of tweet onto a Google sheet and use Watson tone analyser to determine of tweet was positive or negative on tone. If a positive tweet then place content of tweet onto Google slide.”

## 1.2. User Stroies
Our first Stakeholders are tweet users and we aim at distinguishing these tweets in different tones by using Waston Tone Analyzer. After that we add different tweet into different google slides. For example, when a farmer post a tweet with a happy tone, the application automatically recoginze its tone and put it into "happy tone" google slides. 

Marketing user story: As a part of the IBM marketing team, I want to analyse the success of our marketing campains and the public's opinion on IBM products so that we can increase the success of future campains and communicate with our developers over how our products can be improved.
