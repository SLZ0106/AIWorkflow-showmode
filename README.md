##  1.1. Project Brief

“Create a tool which will allow a user to connect a defined set of 3rd party applications and execute actions when conditions have been met. E. G when a tweet containing ‘ibm’ is detected place content of tweet onto a Google sheet and use Watson tone analyser to determine of tweet was positive or negative on tone. If a positive tweet then place content of tweet onto Google slide.”

## 1.2. User Stroies
Our first Stakeholder is our client, John McNamara. As an individual in IBM, he wants to find out what people are saying about the company on Twitter and present his findings. 
He aims to sort thse tweets by using Waston Tone Analyzer and add tweets into corresponding google slides. He would like a tool where he can configure actions on a website, where
he asks the website to go on Twitter and grab tweets relating to IBM and sends it to the Tone analyser and sort them into different slides.
For example, when an IBM customer posts a tweet compaining that the IBM Cloud does not work well sometimes, the application automatically recoginze its tone and put it into the pile of slides where the user is sad.
