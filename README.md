##  1.1. Project Brief

"Create a tool which will allow a user to connect a defined set of 3rd party applications and execute actions when conditions have been met. E. G when a tweet containing ‘ibm’ is detected place content of tweet onto a Google sheet and use Watson tone analyser to determine of tweet was positive or negative on tone. If a positive tweet then place content of tweet onto Google slide."

## 1.2. User Stroies

Marketing user story: As a part of the IBM marketing team, I want to analyse the success of our marketing campains and the public's opinion on IBM products so that we can increase the success of future campains and communicate with our developers over how our products can be improved.

As a software developer, the team would like to create a bot that replies to user Tweets. Using the application, the developer can use the data collected by the application and stored in the database to train a machine learning model and create an AI chatbot that can reply to tweets, e.g. if a user praised an IBM service, the developer’s bot will be able to reply to the user saying thank you.
